Feature requests and code contributions are welcome.

Development Roadmap:
- Reply to @ mentions with latest observation
- Tweet at defined times rather than defined intervals (i.e. 0000, 0600, 0900, 1200, 1500, 1800)
- Auto follow people who follow BuoyBot
- Store history and make observations upon novel observation (e.g. largest wave height, coldest water temp, etc)
- Develop sentience
